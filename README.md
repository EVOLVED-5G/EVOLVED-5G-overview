# EVOLVED-5G overview
The EVOLVED-5G architecture is built around four major environments: Workspace, Validation, Certification and Marketplace.

Following the numbers from the image, four environments are described starting from the Workspace.
### Workspace Environment

The workspace is one of the core architectural environments of the NetApsds ecosystem. The main objective of the Workspace environment is to provide developers with the necessary software tools and instructions for NetApp development while making this process easy, quick and convenient. To do so, it goes through two phases; namely, the NetApp development and verification phases. 

This environment also provides developers with the appropriate code storage repository
(GitHub) where tools and instructions are stored as well as the code of the NetApps generated during the development phase, and an artifact repository (Open Repository) and a Docker Registry where the binaries coming from the verification phase will be stored.

### Validation Environment

The Validation environment is the functional block that is in charge of the validation of the NetApp. The goal of the Validation environment is to provide the tools and methodology required for the execution of the validation process. The validation process includes the evaluation of the functionality of the NetApps when they are used along with the vertical App (vApp) on the platform (Athens or Malaga )as well as performance tests.

Within the lifecycle of a NetApp, the Validation environment is used after a successful
completion of the verification process, i.e., only after a prove that the NetApp is functional and compatible with the 5G APIs. Similarly, the successful completion of the validation process is a pre-condition for a NetApp to enter the certification process.
